# First Maven Web Application

This is a very simple first application to help you practice with IntelliJ, Tomee+ and begin to understand Maven project structure and dependency management. It also provides a review of expression language and beans.

## Getting Started

Detailed instructions are provided in Week 1. At a high level, to begin using this project:

1. Accept the assignment using the link provided in the Week 1 exercise. This will automatically create a copy of the repository for you in GitHub. 
1. From the IntelliJ Welcome Screen, check out the project from GitHub.
1. Edit the run configuration.
1. Build and deploy.
1. Update the application with something unique to you. For example, add your name and an image to the home page.
1. Build and deploy.
1. Verify the changes that you made worked.
1. Take a screenshot of the application running in the browser, including your unique change. 
1. Place the screenshot in the "screenshots" directory of this project/repository.
1. Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub. 
1. Verify that all changes made it to GitHub.
1. Create an issue in GitHub to notify your instructor that your work is complete. 
Go to your repository in GitHub.com, click on ```issues```, and then ```New issue```. 
	- For the issue title, use something like: "Week 1 ready for review". 
	- In the issue detail, at minimum add "@pawaitemadisoncollege week 1 is complete".  The ```@pawaitemadisoncollege``` portion is very important as that will send me a notification. 
	- Within the issue reflect on your learning experience and work for the week by answering, at minimum, the following:
		
		- What were your key learning points/takeaways?
		- What challenged you?
		- What problems did you solve and what resources did you use to solve them?

	- If you have any questions for me or want to communicate anything else related to your week 1 work, feel free to add that into the issue detail as well. 
  	- I will add any feedback into the issue.

## Extra Challenge 1

1. Add a new property to the javabean (User). This could be favorite color, phone number, or whatever you find interesting.
2. Make the changes needed to set a value for the new property in the controller and display the property on the welcome.jsp.

## Extra Challenge 2

1. You'll notice the jsps in this application currently use the directive `@include`. In Advanced Java, we learned that using JSTL tags is preferred. 
2. How would you go about replacing the directive with the appropriate JSTL tag? Consider what you learned about Maven and dependencies this week.
3. What internet search terms would you use to help understand what you need to change to be able to use `<c:import>`?
4. Try it!
